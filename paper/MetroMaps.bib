abstract = {this paper describes an automatic mechanism for drawing metro maps. we apply multicriteria optimization to find effective placement of stations with a good line layout and to label the map unambiguously. a number of metrics are defined, which are used in a weighted sum to find a fitness value for a layout of the map. a hill climbing optimizer is used to reduce the fitness value, and find improved map layouts. to avoid local minima, we apply clustering techniques to the map-the hill climber moves both stations and clusters when finding improved layouts. we show the method applied to a number of metro maps, and describe an empirical study that provides some quantitative evidence that automatically-drawn metro maps can help users to find routes more efficiently than either published maps or undistorted maps. moreover, we have found that, in these cases, study subjects indicate a preference for automatically-drawn maps over the alternatives.},
